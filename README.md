# Project Proposal: The Luck Factor in Career Success: How Economic Climate and Global Events Shape the Future <br/>
## 2.Introduction<br/>
Since we are students and almost every time think about our future, I wanted to show some truths about career success. My project aims to analyze how external factors such as the economic climate, industry trends, and global events at the time of graduation influence career success. By combining historical job market data with economic indicators and major global events, this study will examine whether career plans are significantly affected by the circumstances of one's graduation year which is independent of individual skills and education. The objective is to quantify the role of "luck" in career success and explore whether certain graduation years provide more advantages or challenges than others. 
## 2.Motivation<br/>
Many people believe that career success is driven solely by talent, education, and hard work. However, I want to show that external factors such as economic conditions and industry trends play a significant role. This project aims to investigate these external influences, helping individuals and policymakers understand how global circumstances shape career outcomes. 
<br/>
Understanding these patterns can:<br/>
•	Provide guidance to students and young professionals navigating uncertain job markets.<br/>
•	Help policymakers design interventions to support graduates during economic downturns.<br/>
•	Offer insights for companies in talent acquisition and workforce planning.<br/>
<br/>
## 3. Data Source & Collection Methodology<br/>
This project will use a combination of publicly available datasets enriched with additional data sources:<br/>
#### A- Economic and Labor Market Data<br/>
#### B- Global Events Data<br/>
#### C-	Longitudinal Career Data<br/>
## 4. Data Analysis & Methodology<br/>
Once data collection is complete, I will conduct the following analyses:<br/>
#### A.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br/>
•	Using visuals to examine relationships between graduation year and career success.<br/>
•	Identifying patterns and distributions of periods through histograms and scatter plots.<br/>
•	Applying boxplots to understand variations in success levels before and after some specific events.<br/>
#### B.	Statistical Analysis <br/>
•	Correlation Analysis <br/>
•	Statistical Testing <br/>
## 5. Technical Requirements<br/>
•	Programming Language: Python<br/>
•	Libraries: Pandas, Matplot, Seaborn <br/>
•	Version Control: GitHub (since regular commits needed)<br/>
## Conclusion<br/>
This project aims to determine whether career success is influenced by external economic factors rather than just personal effort and education. By analyzing large-scale employment and economic data, I hope to provide insights that will benefit students, career planners, and policymakers in navigating uncertain job markets.
