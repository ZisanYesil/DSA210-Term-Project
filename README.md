# The Data Behind Women Leaders and National Well-Being <br/>
## 1.Introduction<br/>
In this project, I will explore the relationship between women's leadership and world happiness by analyzing cross-country data. My focus will be to investigate how women's political empowerment correlate with key well-being indicators. This project aims to go beyond surface-level statistics and test deeper questions such as: Do countries with higher women’s political empowerment experience greater happiness? By applying statistical analysis and machine learning models, I want to gain meaningful insights into how empowering women in leadership contributes to national well-being. 
## 2.Motivation<br/>
This project is driven by the aim to explore the broader societal impact of women’s political leadership through data analysis. As a woman pursuing a career in technology and data science, I’m deeply passionate about highlighting the transformative power of women in leadership. In a world still struggling with gender disparities, I want to use data to show that empowering women politically isn’t just a matter of justice, it’s a path to a happier, more balanced world. Through this project, I aim to combine my technical skills with my values, amplifying the message that female leadership is not only powerful but essential for global well-being. The findings can support informed policy-making and further highlight the value of diverse leadership in shaping a more equitable and content world.
## 3. Data Source & Collection Methodology<br/>
This project will use a combination of publicly available datasets enriched with additional data sources:<br/>
#### A- World Happiness Report <br/>
#### B- Women's Political Empowerment Index <br/>
#### C-	Women's Political Participation Index<br/>
#### D-	Average Years of Schooling <br/>
#### E-	Human Development Index <br/>
## 4.	Tools and Technologies<br/>
•	Python: Core language for data manipulation and modeling<br/>
•	Pandas: For data loading, merging, and preprocessing<br/>
•	Seaborn/Matplotlib: For data visualization (e.g., heatmaps, trends)<br/>
•	Google Colab: For cloud-based development and experimentation<br/>
## 5.	Analysis Plan<br/>
#### 1. Data Cleaning & Merging <br/>
•	Standardize country names and match on country + year <br/>
•	Handle missing values via interpolation or dropping based on thresholds <br/>
#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <br/>
•	Summary statistics and trends <br/>
•	Correlation matrices <br/>
•	Distribution of women leadership scores and happiness by region <br/>
#### 3. Hypothesis Testing <br/>
•	H₀: Women’s political empowerment has no effect on national happiness <br/>
•	H₁: Women’s political empowerment has effect on national happiness <br/>
•	Use t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson/Spearman correlation <br/>
#### 4. Regression and prediction <br/>
•	Multiple linear regression and feature importance <br/>
•	Random Forest Regressor to compare effects of different variables (GDP, HDI, women empowerment) <br/>
## 6. Expected Outcomes<br/>
•	A clear understanding of how women’s political empowerment correlates with national happiness<br/>
•	Insights into whether education or development level modifies this effect <br/>
•	A predictive model that identifies which variables are most influential in shaping happiness<br/>
