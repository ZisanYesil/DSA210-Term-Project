# Project Proposal: The Impact of Smartphone Notifications on Productivity and Coffee Consumption <br/>
## 1.Motivation<br/>
Previously, I decided to reduce my coffee consumption due to its negative health effects. However, I soon realized that to be able to do that, I needed to understand why I consumed it in the first place. This led me to research the underlying reasons, and I realized that, in this increasingly digital world, frequent smartphone notifications can be a major source of distraction, affecting productivity and decision-making. Many people, myself included, turn to caffeine as a coping mechanism when struggling to maintain focus. This project seeks to analyze the relationship between notification frequency, focus levels, and coffee consumption, investigating whether increased distractions lead to lower productivity and higher coffee purchases. By understanding these patterns, we can gain insights into how digital distractions influence behavioral and consumption habits.<br/>
## 2. Data Source & Collection Methodology<br/>
To ensure a comprehensive analysis, I will use existing data from my phone and other digital sources. The data will be collected from three main categories: <br/>
#### A.	Notification Frequency<br/>
•	Number of notifications received per hour<br/>
•	Type of notifications<br/>
•	Time spent on phone after receiving notifications<br/>
In order to get this data, I will use my phone’s notification center under the screen time.<br/>
#### B.	Focus & Productivity Levels<br/>
•	Screen time and app usage to measure distractions<br/>
•	Work/study sessions and their efficiency<br/>
To be able to measure my focus and productivity level, I will use my existing data which I use to report to the company that I am currently working on. Since I am working remotely and part-time, I need to report them my work hours and tasks that I finished. <br/>
#### C.	Coffee Purchases<br/>
•	Coffee purchase history, including time of purchase<br/>
•	Productivity level before and after drinking coffee<br/>
To get this data, I will be using the coffee application that I always order coffee.<br/>
## 3. Data Analysis & Methodology<br/>
Once data collection is complete, I will conduct the following analyses:<br/>
#### A.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br/>
•	Using visuals to examine relationships between notification frequency, productivity levels, and coffee purchases.<br/>
•	Identifying patterns and distributions of distraction periods through histograms and scatter plots.<br/>
•	Applying boxplots to understand variations in focus levels before and after coffee intake.<br/>
#### B.	Statistical Analysis <br/>
•	Correlation Analysis: Checking dependencies between notification numbers, productivity drops, and coffee consumption.<br/>
•	Statistical Testing: Comparing coffee intake between different notification levels. Tests to determine categorical relationships between productivity and coffee purchases. <br/>
## 4. Expected Findings<br/>
I want to uncover:<br/>
•	Whether more notifications lead to more distractions and lower productivity<br/>
•	If higher distractions correlate with increased coffee consumption.<br/>
•	Whether coffee actually improves focus level, or if it is just a habit.<br/>
•	Insights into how notification management strategies impact both focus and consumption habits.<br/>
## 5. Technical Requirements<br/>
•	Programming Language: Python<br/>
•	Libraries: Pandas, Matplot, Seaborn <br/>
•	Version Control: GitHub (since regular commits needed)<br/>
## Conclusion<br/>
This project aims to explore the relationship between smartphone notifications, productivity, and coffee consumption, providing valuable insights into how digital distractions shape behavioral and consumption habits. By systematically analyzing notification frequency, focus levels, and coffee purchases through data-driven methodologies, I hope to determine whether increased digital interruptions contribute to reduced productivity and higher caffeine intake. If significant relationships emerge, the findings could offer practical strategies for managing notifications more effectively, improving focus, and reducing unnecessary caffeine consumption. Ultimately, this study will not only enhance my personal understanding of productivity triggers but also provide broader implications for digital well-being and time management.
